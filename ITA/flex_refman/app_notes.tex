\chapter{Applications notes}
\label{ch:app-notes}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------

To help a new developer to get used to the \flex\ platform, including 
both hardware and software components, Evidence Srl proposes a set of 
application notes which implement some common features using the 
available \flex\ Daughter boards. 

Each application note is fully supported by dedicated libraries within 
the \ee\ development tools.



% \begin{warning}
% The Cygwin install pathname, the \ee\ install pathname, and the 
% pathname of \rtd\ workspaces where the user projects reside, MUST NOT 
% contain any blank space, otherwise \ee\ may not work properly.

% This is a known issue that will soon be fixed.
% \end{warning}
