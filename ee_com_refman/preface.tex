\chapter{Introduction}

\ee\ is a free of charge, open-source RTOS implementation of the
OSEK/VDX API, available for various microcontrollers on the web page
\url{http://erika.tuxfamily.org}.

This manual shows the API and specification of the OSEK COM layer
implemented in \ee. The current implementation covers the
implementation of the CCCA and CCCB conformance classes as specified
in the OSEK COM specification version 3.03 available for download on
the web page \url{http://www.osek-vdx.org}.

The features provided by the OSEK COM implementation available in \ee\ are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Support for Conformance Classes CCCA and CCCB\footnote{The project also provides a beta version of CCC0 and CCC1};
\item Support for internal messaging, queued and non-queued;
