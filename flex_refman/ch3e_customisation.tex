A number of possible extensions can be made to the FLEX Base Boards, refer Section ~\ref{sec:base}, to add new functionalities, sensors, network connections, actuators, etc. Simple extensions can be made by hand by either using a Thru Hole Board, refer Subsection ~\ref{subsec:100}, or using a Multibus Base Board, refer Subsection ~\ref{subsec:101}. More decent extensions may require some expertise. This may require some special equipment (e.g. mounting SMD components) to implement a fully functional board. To avoid these problems, Embedded Solutions Srl can handle you specific needs and create a customised Daughter Board for FLEX, refer Section ~\ref{sec:daughter}.\\

\noindent Depending on the number of items to be produced, it could be convenient to re-engineer an entire board together with the Base and the Daughter Boards to save on size, weight, and power consumption. Embedded Solutions also handles prototyping of multilayer boards with SMT and PTH technologies.\\ \\
