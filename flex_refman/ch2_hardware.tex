The modular architecture provided by FLEX allows to compound a number of boards to integrate different features into a single device.\\

\noindent The basic configuration of a FLEX device is made by the main board only. The FLEX Base Board, refer Figure ~\ref{fig:base}, mounts a Microchip dsPIC® DSC micro-controller, and exports almost all the pins of the micro-controller. To build a specific application, the user can easily connect the desired components to the dsPIC® DSC ports.

\noindent As depicted in the Figure ~\ref{fig:piggyback}, several Daughter Boards, refer Section ~\ref{sec:daughter}, can be connected in piggyback fashion to the FLEX Base Board, refer Section ~\ref{sec:base}. The Daughter Boards have different features and they can be easily combined to obtain complex devices, refer Section ~\ref{sec:packs}. Evidence Srl and Embedded Solutions supply a growing number of Daughter Boards for basic and advanced applications.\\
