\noindent FLEX is an embedded board which can be used by developers who intend to exploit the full potential of the latest Microchip micro-controllers of the dsPIC® DSC family.\\

\noindent FLEX is born as a development board to develop and test real-time applications with ease for the Microchip dsPIC® DSC micro-controller.\\

\noindent The main features of FLEX are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Robust electronic design
  \item Modular architecture
  \item Availability of a growing number of application notes
  \item Availability of a code generator which is able to generate C code from a Scilab/Scicos design, and
  \item The full support of the Erika Enterprise real-time kernel from Evidence Srl
\end{itemize}

\noindent The compact design of FLEX makes it suitable not only for development, but also for direct deployment in the work environment like:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Protocol converters
  \item Minimal web servers
  \item Acquisition systems
  \item Wireless systems
  \item Digital control systems
\end{itemize}
